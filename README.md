To modify your code for use with the ESP32, you'll need to make a few adjustments, particularly in the libraries used and the pin assignments. The ESP32 has a different architecture and more features compared to the ESP8266, so some changes are required:

1. Library Changes:
Replace the ESP8266WiFi.h with WiFi.h since the ESP32 uses a different WiFi library.
2. Pin Configuration:
The ESP32 has multiple analog input pins, unlike the ESP8266, which only has one (A0). You'll need to specify the correct GPIO pin for the analog input.
3. Additional Modifications:
Ensure that the correct analog resolution is set since the ESP32 has a 12-bit ADC by default.
Changes and Explanations:
Library Change:

#include <WiFi.h> is used for the ESP32 instead of ESP8266WiFi.h.
Pin Definition:

The analog input pin is changed to GPIO 34 (you can choose any other analog-capable pin).
WiFi Connection:

The code to connect to WiFi remains largely the same, but the ESP32 uses the WiFi.h library.
Analog Read Function:

The analogRead() function is compatible with the ESP32, and the code uses it directly on the specified pin.
Precision in dtostrf:

The precision setting in dtostrf(myecg, 4, 2, str_sensor); remains the same.
This code should work correctly on the ESP32. If you need to change the analog pin or make further modifications, you can adjust the SENSOR_PIN definition accordingly.
